# Force Gravity Forms To Track With Facebook Pixel

Hi! I'm a little snippet of code you can add to the functions.php file of your WordPress installation. I give the Gravity Forms plugin an ability to track submissions via the Facebook pixel.

At the time of my creation on GitHub I was still viable but be sure to check the Gravity Forms website as the ability I give the software may be a new addition to it's functionality at this point.

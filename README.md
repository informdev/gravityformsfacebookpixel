# Force Gravity Forms To Track With Facebook Pixel

Hi! I'm a little code snippet you can add to your WordPress functions.php file. I force the Gravity Forms plugin submissions to include the Facebook pixel for tracking purposes.

At the time of writing this I was still viable but always be sure to check Gravity Forms for updates and news as the ability I give the software may be an added addition by default.
